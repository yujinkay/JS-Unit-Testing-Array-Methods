# JS-Unit-Testing-Array-Methods
In this repo, you'll find a collection of functions that behave exactly like the built-in Array methods including slice, splice, copyWithin, reduceRight, fill, some, every, and so on. 

Utilizing the tinyTest JS library, each method is thoroughly unit tested, accounting for edge cases.
